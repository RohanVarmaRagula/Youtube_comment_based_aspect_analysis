# Youtube_comment_based_aspect_analysis
Using YouTube comments to perform aspect based sentiment analysis and opinion extraction

sentiment - pos score, neg score => Vader senti analysis
text based summarization on aspect => sort pos, neg, relevance => top k each => one

aspect -> search on yt -> pick x no of videos -> extract top y relevant comments -> preprocess -> extract z

problems: 
1. irrelevant comments filter
2. same user comments group or filter ? -> later
